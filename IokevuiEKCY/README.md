Published on Nov 9, 2017
A practical introduction, with live coding, to Project Jigsaw and the Java Platform Module System in Java 9. We’ll construct and hack on a simple modular application to explore the essential aspects of the module system. We’ll see how the module system ensures reliable configuration and strong encapsulation, how it improves security, and how it makes the JDK itself configurable.

Mark Reinhold is Chief Architect of the Java Platform Group at Oracle. His past contributions to the platform include character-stream readers and writers, reference objects, shutdown hooks, the NIO high-performance I/O APIs, library generification, service loaders, and the Jigsaw module system. Mark has held key leadership roles in every Java SE and JDK release since version 1.2, in 1998. He currently leads the JDK Project in the OpenJDK Community, where he also serves on the Governing Board. Mark holds a Ph.D. in computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
